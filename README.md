# Next-Generation Pose Detection with MoveNet

Welcome to our tutorial on using the cutting-edge Pose Detection model from Google Research, MoveNet. This model can detect up to 17 keypoints on the human body, making it a powerful tool for real-time applications.

## MoveNet Architecture Overview

MoveNet operates on heatmaps to precisely localize human keypoints. It's a bottom-up estimation model which means it first detects the joints across all persons in the frame and then assembles these joints into distinct poses for each person.

### Key Components of MoveNet:
- **Feature Extractor**: Utilizes MobileNetV2 combined with a Feature Pyramid Network. [Learn more about MobileNetV2](https://example.com)
- **Predictor Heads**: Attached to the feature extractor and are responsible for predicting:
  - Geometric center of the instances (persons)
  - Full set of keypoints for a person
  - Location of all keypoints
  - Local offsets from each output feature map pixel to the exact sub-pixel location of each keypoint

## Setting Up the Environment

Ensure you have all the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install cv2 imageio matplotlib tensorflow tensorflow_hub
pip install -q git+https://github.com/tensorflow/docs
